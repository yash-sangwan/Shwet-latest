# Introduction to Shwet



Shwet is an incentivized open source collaboration tool for Data, AI, ML. Open source contributors who want to earn passive income can complete tasks assigned by organizations (data labelling & annotation, human feedback for RLHF models, etc.) and will earn payments and incentives as Shwet Tokens. Leveraging the power of Solana and zk-compression, thousands of daily payments will be handled with less fees, benefitting both our contributors and customers.
